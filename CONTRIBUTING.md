# Contributing

## Setup
1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/name`
3. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`

## Code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep components < 200 lines if possible
- Add comments for non-trivial logic
- Prefer functional components + hooks

## PR checklist
- [ ] README updated if feature affects usage
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Tested manually for main flows
- [ ] Accessibility tested (keyboard)
